# Uno AI

This project contains the code which I used to create an AI agent that can play the card game with rules based on Uno, and win against a random opponent 60% of games.
Currently, the best trained model is Traning/Uno_Model_MaskablePPO_10M.zip
You can play against any of the existing trained models or against any others you train by running the code in ai_pgz.py
